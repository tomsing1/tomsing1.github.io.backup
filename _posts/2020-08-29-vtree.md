# `vtree`: Visualizing nested relationships

When I start the analysis of a new dataset, the first step is often to understand the relationships
between the samples / subjects and observations within in it.

The [gtsummary](https://github.com/ddsjoberg/gtsummary) R package is my go-to option for creating overview tables. 
Here is a quick overview of the surival rates of the `Titanic` shipwreck:

```r
library(gtsummary)
library(dplyr)

class(Titanic)  # array with counts
titanic <- crosstabToCases(Titanic)
```

The `titanic` data.frame holds 2201 rows, one for each passenger,
and lists each subject ticket `Class`, their `Sex` and `Age` and whether they
survived the shipwreck:

We start with a data.frame that has one row for each observation, and provides
information about the *variables* in separate columns.

```r
head(titanic)  # data.frame with individual outcomes
```

```
  Class  Sex   Age Survived
1   3rd Male Child       No
2   3rd Male Child       No
3   3rd Male Child       No
4   3rd Male Child       No
5   3rd Male Child       No
6   3rd Male Child       No
```

The `tbl_summary` function provides a quick overview of the number of passengers 
in each `Class` and their survival rates:

```r
titanic %>%
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(by = c("Class"))
```

This table highlights that there are nested relationships, e.g. you might be interested
in the survival of adult female passengers traveling with a first-class ticket only. 

I find such nested relations easier to understand in a graphical form. Today I learned about
the [vtree](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vtree/index.html) R package, 
which displays information about nested subsets of a data frame.

A single command creates a `variable tree`, complete with summary statistics at each node:

```r
library(vtree)
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived")
```

![vtree example output](vtree_example.png)

The [vtree vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vtree/vignettes/vtree.html) 
is incredibly detailed and highlights how to control
almost every aspect of the tree, including the summary statistics shown for
each node, the display options, colors, selection of nodes to include / exclude,
etc.

```r
# create a vertical layout instead
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived", horiz = FALSE)

# get the same information as a table
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived",
        ptable = TRUE)

# draw a `pattern tree`, separately displaying the paths to the leaves
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived",
        pattern = TRUE, showroot = TRUE, seq = TRUE)

# exclude any group with < 10 counts
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived",
        prunesmaller = 20)

# omit counts downstream of the `Crew` class
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived",
        prunebelow = list(Class="Crew"))

# add custom text to one or more nodes
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", showvarnames = FALSE, 
        text = list(Class=c(Crew="\n*Did all the work*")))

# change a label
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived",
        labelnode=list(Sex=c("M"="Male","F"="Female")))

# add a legend instead of node labels
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived",
        showlegend = TRUE, shownodelabels = FALSE)

# `sameline=TRUE` displays node labels on the same line as the summary
titanic %>%
  vtree("Class Sex Age", summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived",
        sameline = TRUE)
```
