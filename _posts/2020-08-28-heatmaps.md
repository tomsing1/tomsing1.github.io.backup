# Communicating information through heatmaps

When you have lots of measurements for lots of samples, heatmaps can be a great way to communicate the patterns you have observed.
And if you have additional information about your samples, e.g. treatment groups, genotypes, age, etc, the [ComplexHeatmap](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/) package offers options to display them at the same time.
